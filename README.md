# This is BoomMapper.
BoomMapper is the new official map editor for BoomBox, built off of [ChroMapper](https://github.com/Caeden117/ChroMapper).

## Features
- **Optimized** to run on a wide range of devices, from high-end VR machines to [Chromebooks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/702231982335197264/892184054147993640/20210927_190030.jpg).
- **Cross-platform** with the ability to run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, and more.
- **Rebindable Keys** means you can adapt your mapping workflow to whatever input device you have installed.
- **Localized** for many different languages, so that everyone can map.

## Changes from ChroMapper
- Entire program has been converted to use the BoomBox pack/map format.
- All content related to Beat Saber (including code, assets, and ChroMapper features) have been completely removed.
- Switch to Newtonsoft.JSON as the primary JSON library over SimpleJSON.
